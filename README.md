3D Robotic Arm Project (Tinkercad)

This project involves designing a simple 3D robotic arm using Tinkercad. The arm consists of a base, rotating joints, and two main arm segments, assembled using basic shapes (boxes, cylinders, spheres). Each part is modeled separately to allow future movement or printing.
 • Tools Used: Tinkercad
 • Parts: Base, shoulder joint, upper arm, elbow joint, lower arm, wrist
 • Goal: Create a simple, modular robotic arm model suitable for 3D printing or simulation.
